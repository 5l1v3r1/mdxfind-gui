# MDXfind GUI

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/s3inlc/mdxfind-gui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/s3inlc/mdxfind-gui)

This code was running successfully on Linux, for Windows some of the system calls perhaps need to be adapted, but the normal code should run there too.

### Building MDXfind GUI

To build this GUI you need Qt installed. Either you can directly open the .pro file with the Qt Designer (if installed) or run ```qmake mdxfind-gui.pro``` and then ```make```. Libraries for Qt need to be installed.
